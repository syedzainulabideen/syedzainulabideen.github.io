      <description>@ViewBuilder is a parameter attribute that constructs child views from closures in a resulable manner. @ViewBuilder is one of the possible result builders provided in Swift language. Every element in SwiftUI, uses @ViewBuilder to build it&amp;rsquo;s child Views. Like HStack:
struct ContentView: View { var body: some View { HStack{ Text(&amp;#34;First Text&amp;#34;) Text(&amp;#34;Second Text&amp;#34;) } } } And if we check the defination of HStack, We can see the it gets content using the @ViewBuilder.</description>

      <title>SwiftUI - View Modifiers</title>

      <description>ViewModifier is a basically a protocol that used to encapsulate and apply a set of changes or modifications to a view. It has a body(content: Content) that accept a user-defined content and return some View after applying changes or modifications.
It is very useful when you have a set of modifications like Stylings or Behaviours etc. and you want to apply them on multiple views without code being redundant.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand by an example.</description>

      <title>SwiftData - An Introduction</title>

      <description>Kindly be aware that the provided code snippets rely on Xcode 15 beta 6. Consequently, there is a possibility of encountering syntax inconsistencies in forthcoming beta releases.
Finally, during WWDC 2023, Apple made the decision to upgrade its primary persistence framework CoreData with SwiftData. This involved adopting a more robust framework that takes advantage of the recently introduced Macros system and other advanced language features for the purpose of data modelling and management.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-dependency-inversion/</link>

      <description>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. By DIP we aimed to reduce coupling between high-level and low-level classes or components by introducing an abstraction layer between them.
So one can think, what does tight coupling or dependency between high and low level modules means? Let me explain, Tight coupling occurs when there is a strong, direct relationship between two modules.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-interface-segregation/</link>

      <guid>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-interface-segregation/</guid>
      <description>ISP states that clients ( classes or modules that use an protocol ) should not be forced to depend on protocols they do not use. This implies that we need to structure our protocols or interfaces in a manner that precisely fulfills the requirements of the entities that adhere to them.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand by a quick example. Suppose you have multiple payment methods available in your codebase.
// Protocol for processing payments protocol PaymentMethod { func processPayment(amount: Double) func refundPayment(amount: Double) } // Classes that implement the protocol class CreditCardPayment: PaymentMethod { func processPayment(amount: Double) { print(&amp;#34;Processing credit card payment of $\(amount)&amp;#34;) // Actual payment processing logic for credit card } func refundPayment(amount: Double) { print(&amp;#34;Refunding credit card payment of $\(amount)&amp;#34;) // Actual refund processing logic for credit card } } class PayPalPayment: PaymentMethod { func processPayment(amount: Double) { print(&amp;#34;Processing PayPal payment of $\(amount)&amp;#34;) // Actual payment processing logic for PayPal } func refundPayment(amount: Double) { /* Imagine a scenario where there&amp;#39;s no refund policy applicable to PayPal transactions.</description>

      <title>SOLID: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</title>

      <guid>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-liskov-substitution/</guid>
      <description>LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
Subclasses should preserve the core functionalities provided by the Super classes and should not override or change them. Also subclasses should adhere the rules or contracts defined by the Super classes like method signatures, preconditions, postconditions etc.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take an example to show how code can violate the LSP.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Open Close Principle (OCP)</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-open-close/</link>

      <guid>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-open-close/</guid>
      <description>OCP states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In simple words it means that once a entity is created and working as intended, its internal code should not be modified to add new features or behaviors.
So how can then we add features or update the functionalities? And the answer is by extending the existing entities with by Subclassing, Extensions or Protocols/Interfaces etc.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-single-responsibility/</link>

      <guid>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-single-responsibility/</guid>
      <description>SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change or only one responsibility. In other words, a class should have a single, well-defined purpose.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand this concept with a quick example. Suppose we have a User class and also there are two functioanlities accociated with this class i.e. saveToDatabase and sendWelcomeEmail.
Now condier the below code snippet that&amp;rsquo;s without the usage of SRP principle. We embedded the two functionality right into the User class.</description>

      <title>Dependency Injection vs Dependency Inversion</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/dependency-injection-vs-dependency-inversion/</link>

      <guid>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/dependency-injection-vs-dependency-inversion/</guid>
      <description>Dependency injection and dependency inversion are two concepts used in software development to manage dependencies between different components of a system. While they are related, they have distinct purposes and approaches.
Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows components to be loosely coupled by providing their dependencies from external sources. In other words, instead of hardcoding dependencies within a component, the dependencies are passed to it from the outside. This promotes flexibility, modularity, and easier testing.</description>

      <description>Hey Readers, In this tutorial we are looking into the Integration of Stripe’s In-Person Payment using Stripe Reader M2. Below are the quick overview of steps, we will be following.
Steps Overview: Create Locations: To organize your readers, you need to create locations e.g. Every reader is linked to the specific location of your physical store location.
You can either create location using Stripe Dashboard or using the Terminal’s SDK by following here</description>
