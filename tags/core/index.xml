      <title>SOLID: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</title>

      <description>LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
Subclasses should preserve the core functionalities provided by the Super classes and should not override or change them. Also subclasses should adhere the rules or contracts defined by the Super classes like method signatures, preconditions, postconditions etc.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take an example to show how code can violate the LSP.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Open Close Principle (OCP)</title>

      <description>OCP states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In simple words it means that once a entity is created and working as intended, its internal code should not be modified to add new features or behaviors.
So how can then we add features or update the functionalities? And the answer is by extending the existing entities with by Subclassing, Extensions or Protocols/Interfaces etc.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</title>
      <link>https://syedzainulabideen.github.io/posts/solid-single-responsibility/</link>

      <description>SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change or only one responsibility. In other words, a class should have a single, well-defined purpose.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand this concept with a quick example. Suppose we have a User class and also there are two functioanlities accociated with this class i.e. saveToDatabase and sendWelcomeEmail.
Now condier the below code snippet that&amp;rsquo;s without the usage of SRP principle. We embedded the two functionality right into the User class.</description>
